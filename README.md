# RidgeMooreExorcism

A 2D top-down horror game built with Angular.

## Live Demo

You can play the game live at [https://shaizel.github.io/ridge-moore-exorcism](https://shaizel.github.io/ridge-moore-exorcism).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Building

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.

```bash
ng e2e
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
